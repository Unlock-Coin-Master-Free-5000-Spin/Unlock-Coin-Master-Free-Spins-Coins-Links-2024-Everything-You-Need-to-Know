### What is Coin Master?

Before diving into how you can get your hands on free spins and coins, it's essential to understand the mechanics of *Coin Master*. Developed by Moon Active, *Coin Master* combines elements of slot machines, building games, and attack-and-defend mechanics, creating a unique gaming experience. The objective of the game is simple‚Äîbuild your village, collect cards, and battle against other players.

Players use spins to play the in-game slot machine, which yields rewards in the form of coins, spins, pets, and attack/raid actions. These actions are key to progressing in the game, allowing you to earn resources, raid other players' villages, and even attack them. The more you progress, the more challenging the villages become, and the more resources you‚Äôll need.
